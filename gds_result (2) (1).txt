1. Assessment of the Anti-Tumor Effects of Poly(I:C) Combined with QS-21 on Melanoma Cells(B16F10)
(Submitter supplied) This study explores the synergistic antitumor potential of Poly(I:C) and QS-21 in melanoma treatment. Through in vitro assays and animal models, we evaluated their combined impact on melanoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune response. Our results indicate that Poly(I:C), an immunostimulant, activates the immune system to bolster antitumor activity. QS-21, an immunological adjuvant, enhances Poly(I:C)'s effects, together acting as an in situ vaccine to expose neoantigens and reignite the tumor-immune interaction. more...

6. CD133+PD-L1+ cancer cells confer resistance to adoptively transferred engineered macrophage-based therapy in melanoma.
(Submitter supplied) Adoptive transfer of genetically or nanoparticle-engineered macrophages represents a promising cell therapy modality for treatment of solid tumor. However, the therapeutic efficacy is suboptimal without achieving a complete tumor regression, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we discover a subpopulation of cancer cells with upregulated CD133 and programmed death-ligand 1 in mouse melanoma, resistant to the phagocytosis by the transferred macrophages. more...

7. PTP inhibition improves the macrophage anti-tumor immune response and the efficacy of chemo- and radiotherapy
(Submitter supplied) Traditional anti-cancer therapies induce tumor cell death and subsequent release of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) that activate the innate inflammatory response. Paradoxically, after treatment macrophages often adopt a pro-wound healing phenotype that contributes to cancer progression. We found that tumor cells upregulate the expression of Pros1 in areas proximal to cell damage. Tumor-secreted Pros1 binds to the macrophage Mer receptor, effectively limiting responsiveness to DAMPs by preventing Toll Like Receptor (TLR) signal transduction. more...

12. Propafenone facilitates mitochondrial-associated ferroptosis and synergizes with immunotherapy in melanoma
(Submitter supplied) Despite the successful application of immunotherapy, both innate and acquired resistance are typical in melanoma. Ferroptosis induction appears to be a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the relationship between the status of ferroptosis and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, as well as viable strategies to augment ferroptosis, remain unclear. In this study, through large-scale drug screening of cardiovascular drugs, we identified propafenone, an anti-arrhythmia medication, as capable of synergizing with ferroptosis inducers in melanoma. more...

(Submitter supplied) NAMPT is expressed in all cells during normal cell homeostasis. However, melanoma cells have a higher energetic demand and increase NAMPT expression. Our data show that IFNg signaling upregulates NAMPT in both human and mouse melanoma cells leading to increased cell growth and expression kinetics. The purpose of this experiment was to identify how IFNg inducible Nampt alters cell kinetics and we did this by treating melanoma cells with the combination of IFNg and FK866.

However, it is largely unknown about whether tumor cell enhancer regulation plays a role in tumor immune evasion and anti-tumor immune response. Here, we demonstrate that tumor cell deletion of Mll3 and Mll4, two members of COMPASS family for enhancer H3K4 mono-methylation, increases tumor cell immunogenicity and promotes anti-tumor immune response. more...

By inoculating C57BL/6 mice with different numbers of B16F10 cells, we establish an early-early melanoma model. We find that mice inoculated with lower number of B16F10 cells develop tumors at a later time. Therefore the blood samples collected at day 14 post-injection before the formation of visible tumors are early-early cancer samples. more...

(Submitter supplied) 2D culture as a model for drug testing often turns to be clinically futile. Therefore, 3D cultures (3Ds) show potential to better model responses to drugs observed in vivo. In preliminary studies, using melanoma (B16F10) and renal (RenCa) cancer, we confirmed that 3Ds better mimics the tumor microenvironment. Here, we evaluate how the proposed 3D mode of culture affects tumor cell susceptibility to anti-cancer drugs, which have distinct mechanisms of action (everolimus, doxorubicin, cisplatin). more...

(Submitter supplied) Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal drivers of anti-tumor immunity, but many of the DCs in tumors appear dysfunctional or immunosuppressive.  Using mouse models, we found that robustly immunogenic DCs can arise by differentiation from immature myeloid precursor cells during inflammation.  In tumors, however, differentiation of these inflammatory DCs was blocked by a cell-intrinsic signaling pathway created by Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and the tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).

162. Global gene expression profile of Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV) infected cytolytic B16F10 and Non-cytolytic JEV resistant B16F10r
(Submitter supplied) B16F10, a murine melanoma cel line is cytolytic to JEV infection. We have identified a B16F10 cell line variant which is non-cytolytic to JEV infection.  This variant cell line has two types of cells, one which is persistently infected JEV and another which is resistant to JEV infection.  The JEV-resistant cells (B16F10r) were seperated from the presistently infected cells by single cell cloning.   To understand the mechanism of JEV resistance microarray analysis was caried out to Identify and characterize  genes differentially expressed during in uninfected/JEV-infected B16F10 and B16F10r cells.

165. Gene expression profile of murine cutaneous melanoma after systemic treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) associated or not with melphalan (MEL).
(Submitter supplied) Cutaneous melanomas are malignant radio and chemoresistant neoplasias presenting high morbidity and elevated mortality rates. Isolated Limb Perfusion (ILP) with Melphalan (Mel) is used in the treatment of non-resectable locally advanced melanomas of extremity sparing the limb from amputation in 40-50% of the cases. Adding the Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (Tnfa) improves total complete response to 70-90%. more...

166. Sox10 controls migration of melanoma cells through multiple regulatory target genes
(Submitter supplied) It is believed that the inherent differentiation program of melanocytes during embryogenesis predisposes melanoma cells to high frequency of metastasis. Sox10, a transcription factor expressed in neural crest stem cells and a subset of progeny lineages, plays a key role in the development of melanocytes. We show that B16F10 melanoma cells transfected with siRNA specific for Sox10 display reduced migratory activity which in turn indicated that a subset of transcriptional regulatory target genes of Sox10 are likely to be involved in migration and metastasis of melanoma cells. more...

167. PITX1 suppresses TERT transcription
(Submitter supplied) Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) into the mouse melanoma cell line, B16F10, we have previously found that human chromosome 5 carries a gene, or genes, that can negatively regulate TERT expression. To identify the gene responsible for the regulation of TERT transcription, we performed cDNA microarray analysis using parental B16F10 cells, telomerase negative B16F10 microcell hybrids with a human chromosome 5 (B16F10MH5), and its revertant clones (MH5R) with reactivated telomerase. more...
