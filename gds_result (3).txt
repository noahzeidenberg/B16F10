1. Endogenous viral elements constitute a complementary source of antigens for personalized cancer immunotherapy
(Submitter supplied) We present a pipeline, ObsERV, for the design of personalized cancer immunotherapies based on epitopes derived from endogenous retroviral elements (EVEs). We show that EVE-derived peptides are presented as antigens on tumors and can be predicted by ObsERV. Preclinical testing of ObsERV demonstrates elicitation of poly-functional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses as well as long-term tumor protection and persistence of the responses.

4. AMPK is necessary for Treg functional adaptation to microenvironmental stress during malignancy and viral pneumonia
(Submitter supplied) CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells maintain self-tolerance, suppress the immune response to cancer, and protect against tissue injury in the lung and other organs. Treg cells require mitochondrial metabolism to exert their function, but how Treg cells adapt their metabolic programs to sustain and optimize their function during an immune response occurring in a metabolically stressed microenvironment remains unclear. more...

5. Glycocalyx micro- and nanodomains in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions revealed by sensitive click chemistry
(Submitter supplied) The glycocalyx consists of glycoproteins, glycolipids and extracellular polysaccharides at the cell surface which mediate viscoelastic and electrostatic barrier function. In molecular interactions the glycocalyx is thought to segregate locally to facilitate receptor-ligand binding, yet high-resolution maps of glycocalyx domains in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are lacking. We here applied TMTH-sulfoximine (THS)-based biorthogonal chemistry in live-cell culture and demonstrate much-enhanced glycocalyx detection, compared to established  dibenzocyclooctyne-based labeling. more...

6. Muscleblind-like proteins are novel modulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment
(Submitter supplied) Exploiting the immune system to target and eradicate cancer cells is an area of intense clinical study. However, the underlying mechanisms that shape the tumor-immune microenvironment remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins as novel modulators of the tumor microenvironment across diverse cancer types. Initially, in a mouse melanoma model, we demonstrate that loss of MBNL expression drives reduced cytotoxic CD8+ T cell tumor infiltrate and increased tumor cell viability. more...

(Submitter supplied) Naïve CD4 T cells are traditionally viewed as a quiescent, homogeneous, resting population, but merging evidence reveals their heterogeneity, which can be crucial for understanding disease contexts and therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we identify distinct subpopulations within both murine and human naïve CD4 T cells by single cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), particularly focusing on a subpopulation that expresses super-high levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7Rsup-hi), along with CD97, IL-18R, and Ly6C. more...

10. Microglial reprogramming enhances anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy response in melanoma brain metastases [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Melanoma is one of the solid tumor types with the highest risk of brain metastasis. However, the biology of melanoma brain metastasis and the contribution of the brain immune microenvironment to the responses to therapies remain insufficiently characterized. By using preclinical models and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify microglia, as critical regulators of melanoma biology in the brain. We show that activation of the Rela/NF-kB pathway in microglia promotes melanoma brain metastasis and that targeting this pathway elicits microglia reprogramming towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype that enhances anti-tumor immunity and reduces brain metastatic burden. more...

13. Cancer cells avoid ferroptosis induced by immune cells via fatty acid binding proteins [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Abstract Background Cancer creates an immunosuppressive environment that hampers immune responses, allowing tumors to grow and resist therapy. One way the immune system fights back is by inducing ferroptosis, a type of cell death, in tumor cells through CD8+ T cells. This involves lipid peroxidation and enzymes like lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3), which makes cells more prone to ferroptosis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been successfully applied in clinical settings as a standard therapy for many cancer types, but its clinical efficacy is restricted to patients with immunologically hot tumors. Various strategies to modify the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, have been explored but have not been successful. Here, we identified a mechanism of acquired resistance to combination treatment consisting of an agonist for multiple TLRs, OK-432 (Picibanil), and PD-1 blockade. more...

21. PTP inhibition improves the macrophage anti-tumor immune response and the efficacy of chemo- and radiotherapy
(Submitter supplied) Traditional anti-cancer therapies induce tumor cell death and subsequent release of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) that activate the innate inflammatory response. Paradoxically, after treatment macrophages often adopt a pro-wound healing phenotype that contributes to cancer progression. We found that tumor cells upregulate the expression of Pros1 in areas proximal to cell damage. Tumor-secreted Pros1 binds to the macrophage Mer receptor, effectively limiting responsiveness to DAMPs by preventing Toll Like Receptor (TLR) signal transduction. more...

(Submitter supplied) PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is revolutionizing cancer therapy, but little is known about the mechanisms governing its expression. In a whole-genome, dual- marker FACS-based CRISPR-Cas9 screen in primary murine CD8 T cells, we found that inactivation of the EMP24/GP25L/p24 protein family, most prominently TMED10, reduced PD-1 cell-surface stability, thereby augmenting T cell activity. Treatment with TMED inhibitor AGN192403 led to lysosomal degradation of the TMED-PD-1 complex and reduced PD-1 expression in intratumoral CD8 T cells in mice, thus reversing T cell dysfunction. more...

36. Propafenone facilitates mitochondrial-associated ferroptosis and synergizes with immunotherapy in melanoma
(Submitter supplied) Despite the successful application of immunotherapy, both innate and acquired resistance are typical in melanoma. Ferroptosis induction appears to be a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the relationship between the status of ferroptosis and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, as well as viable strategies to augment ferroptosis, remain unclear. In this study, through large-scale drug screening of cardiovascular drugs, we identified propafenone, an anti-arrhythmia medication, as capable of synergizing with ferroptosis inducers in melanoma. more...

37. Tumor-derived small extracellular vesicle PD-L1 impedes macrophage-mediated antibacterial immunity in preexisting malignancy
(Submitter supplied) Tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (TEVs) were reported to carry various immunosuppressive molecules regulating immune response. We previously reported that TEV could express PD-L1 to systematically inhibit CD8 T cell anti-tumor immunity. Here, we observed that TEV PD-L1 suppressed the phagocytosis and bactericidal capacity of macrophages against E. coli. To investigate the potential mechanisms behind the impaired phagocytosis further, we collected and purified exosomes from the melanoma cell line B16-F10 PD-L1 knockout (KO) or vector culture to challenge RAW264.7 cells. more...

41. Itaconate transporter SLC13A3 impairs tumor immunity via endowing ferroptosis resistance
(Submitter supplied) Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) triggers tumor ferroptosis. However, most patients are unresponsive to ICB. Tumors might evade ferroptosis in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we discovered SLC13A3 is an itaconate transporter in tumor cells and endows tumor ferroptosis resistance, diminishing tumor immunity and ICB efficacy. Mechanistically, tumor cells uptake itaconate via SLC13A3 from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), thereby activating the NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway and escaping from immune-mediated ferroptosis. more...

In particular, intratumoral high potassium has shown its immune-suppression potency on T cells. However, as a pan-cancer characteristic related to local necrosis, the impact of this ionic disturbance on innate immunity is still unknown. Here, using both murine and human samples, we reveal that intratumoral high potassium leads to profound suppression of the anti-tumor capacity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). more...

71. Nutrient-Delivery and Metabolism Reactivation Therapy for Melanoma
(Submitter supplied) To fulfil the demands of rapid proliferation, tumour cells, including those in melanoma, undergo significant metabolic alterations, with some pathways being upregulated while others are downregulated. Suppression of hyperactivated metabolism has been proven to counteract tumour growth. However, whether the reactivation of inversely downregulated metabolic pathways has therapeutic effects remains unexplored. more...

75. Induction of fatty acid oxidation underlies DNA damage-induced cell death and ameliorates obesity-driven chemoresistance
(Submitter supplied) The DNA damage response is essential for preserving genome integrity and eliminating damaged cells. Although cellular metabolism plays a central role in cell fate decision between proliferation, survival or death, the metabolic response to DNA damage remains largely obscure. Here, we show that DNA damage induces fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which is required for DNA damage-induced cell death. Mechanistically, FAO induction increases cellular acetyl-CoA levels and promotes N-alpha-acetylation of caspase-2, leading to cell death. more...

82. NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment[scRNA-seq_1]
(Submitter supplied) Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as "exhaustion". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. more...

86. CD39+ CD4+ conventional T cells with exhaustion traits and cytotoxic potential infiltrate tumors and expand upon CTLA4 blockade
(Submitter supplied) CD4+ conventional T (Tconv) lymphocytes display an important role in tumor immunity; however, their contribution to tumor elimination remains poorly understood. Here we describe a subset of tumor-infiltrating Tconv cells characterized by the expression of CD39. In mouse cancer models CD39+ Tconv cells accumulate with tumor growth but are absent in lymphoid organs. Compared to tumor CD39- Tconv cells, CD39+ cells exhibit a cytotoxic and exhausted signature at the transcriptomic level, confirmed by high protein expression of co-inhibitory receptors and transcription factors related to exhaustion. more...

In fact, Atp2a2 KO T cells have increased function, whereas Atp2a2 KO tumor cells die. Thapsigargin is a drug that targets the protein product of Atp2a2: Serca2b. We found that in tumor cells, the SAGA complex transmits TG signals to induce tumor cell death, principally via Ccdc101.

Previous studies reported that the oligoclonal expansion in tumor T-cell repertoire is associated with anti-tumor effects. However, the contribution of the expansion of diverse T-cell clones remained unclear. We demonstrated that the polyclonal fraction of tumor-reactive T-cell repertoire consisting of relatively minor clones, increased in tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-L1 or anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), while the oligoclonal fraction consisting of major clones was unchanged. more...

(Submitter supplied) The anti-tumor effects of IFNγ are well-known as IFNγ binding to tumor cells increases antigen presentation and can cause cytostatic growth defects. Indeed, the inability of tumors to respond to IFNγ often renders tumors resistant to checkpoint blockade and other immunotherapies reliant on direct T cell cytotoxicity. We demonstrate through RNA-sequencing that IFNgR1-/- and STAT1-/- tumors are defective in their response to IFNγ compared to wild-type tumors.

Herein we show that Ahr acts as a promoter of resident memory CD8+ T cell (TRM) differentiation and function. Under steady state conditions or in an oral infection model, genetic ablation of Ahr in CD8+ T cells leads to an increase in CD127–KLRG1+ short lived effector cells (TSLE) and CD44+CD62L+ T central memory (TCM) cells, but a reduction in Granzyme B-producing CD69+CD103+ T resident memory (TRM) cells. more...

146. Tripartite target-agnostic combination immunotherapy cures established poorly immunogenic tumors
(Submitter supplied) Single-agent immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, has shown remarkable efficacy in selected cancer entities and individual patients. However, most patients fail to respond. This is likely due to diverse immunosuppressive mechanisms acting in a concerted way to suppress the host anti-tumor immune response reducing the efficacy of single-agent immunotherapy. Combination immunotherapy approaches that are effective in such poorly immunogenic tumors mostly rely on precise knowledge of immunological targets on tumor cells by vaccinations or antibodies engineered to directly target those. more...

(Submitter supplied) The tumor immune microenvironment is complex in composition, function and dynamic, influencing the evolution of tumor, prognosis and response to immunotherapy. Recent studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of the roles of Gasdermin protein-mediated tumoral pyroptosis activated by caspases and granzymes from cytotoxic lymphocytes in facilitating the killing of tumor cells. However, the pyroptosis of immune cells in tumor microenvironment and their affecting the reprogram of the tumor microenvironment remains poorly understood. more...

150. Enhancer decommissioning by MLL4 ablation elicits dsRNA-interferon signaling and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis to potentiate anti-tumor immunity
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptional enhancers instruct spatiotemporal gene expression and their dysfunction has long been known as one of the primary mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and confer malignant tumor cell behaviors. However, it is largely unknown about whether tumor cell enhancer regulation plays a role in tumor immune evasion and anti-tumor immune response. Here, we demonstrate that tumor cell deletion of Mll3 and Mll4, two members of COMPASS family for enhancer H3K4 mono-methylation, increases tumor cell immunogenicity and promotes anti-tumor immune response. more...

155. Sensitizing Resistant Cancer Cells to T cell-secreted Cytokines
(Submitter supplied) Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to cancer therapy, including immunotherapy. Activated T cells can efficiently kill tumor cells following recognition of MHC class I (MHC-I) bound peptides, but this selection pressure favors outgrowth of MHC-I deficient tumor cells. We performed a genome-scale screen to discover alternative pathways for T cell-mediated killing of MHC-I deficient tumor cells. Autophagy and TNF signaling emerged as top pathways, and inactivation of Rnf31 (TNF signaling) and Atg5 (autophagy) sensitized MHC-I deficient tumor cells to apoptosis by T cell-derived cytokines. more...

MICA/B serve as ligands for the activating NKG2D receptor on T cells and NK cells, but tumors evade immune recognition by proteolytic MICA/B cleavage.  Vaccine-induced antibodies increased the density of MICA/B proteins on the surface of tumor cells by inhibiting proteolytic shedding, increased presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells to T cells, and enhanced the cytotoxic function of NK cells. more...

183. Next generation sequencing of blood platelets and PBMCs in early and late stage of melanoma in mice
(Submitter supplied) We report the application of next generation sequencing of blood platelets in an early-early melanoma mice model for screening early cancer biomarkers. By inoculating C57BL/6 mice with different numbers of B16F10 cells, we establish an early-early melanoma model. We find that mice inoculated with lower number of B16F10 cells develop tumors at a later time. Therefore the blood samples collected at day 14 post-injection before the formation of visible tumors are early-early cancer samples. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here we report an enzyme-activatable assembled peptide FR17 that can serve as a “flame-retarding blanket” at pre-metastatic niche (PMN) specifically to extinguish the “fire” of tumor-supportive microenvironment adaption. Our experiment demonstrated that the assembled peptide successfully reversed extracellular matrix deposition, vascular leakage and angiogenesis through inhibition on fibroblasts activation in PMN, which suppressed the remodeling of metastasis-supportive host stromal, and further prevented the recruitment of myeloid cells to PMN and then recovered the immunosuppressive microenvironment. more...

185. Intermittent Administration of Tacrolimus Enhances Anti-Tumor Immunity in Melanoma-Bearing Mice
(Submitter supplied) One key reason for T cell exhaustion is continuous antigen exposure. Early exhausted T cells can reverse exhaustion and differentiate into fully functional memory T cells if removed from persisting antigen stimulation. Therefore, this study viewed T cell exhaustion as an over-activation status induced by chronic antigen stimuli. This study hypothesized that blocking TCR signal intermittently to terminate over-activation signal can defer the developmental process of T cell exhaustion. more...

(Submitter supplied) 2D culture as a model for drug testing often turns to be clinically futile. Therefore, 3D cultures (3Ds) show potential to better model responses to drugs observed in vivo. In preliminary studies, using melanoma (B16F10) and renal (RenCa) cancer, we confirmed that 3Ds better mimics the tumor microenvironment. Here, we evaluate how the proposed 3D mode of culture affects tumor cell susceptibility to anti-cancer drugs, which have distinct mechanisms of action (everolimus, doxorubicin, cisplatin). more...

215. Most cancer cell lines give very modest transcriptional regulation following treatment with the SUMO activating enzyme inhibitors TAK-981 or ML-792
(Submitter supplied) Modest transcriptional changes has been previously observed in solid tumor cell lines in response to inhibition of SUMOylation by ML-792 and here confirmed with TAK-981, lacking a robust induction of IFN1 genes. Comparable modulation of gene expression in HCT116, MDA-MB-231 and Colo-205 cells by TAK-981 and ML-792. Biological triplicates of HCT116, MDA-MB-231 and Colo-205 cells treated with DMSO, 1 μM ML-792 or 1 μM TAK-981 in vitro for 16 h were analyzed by RNA-Seq. more...

216. Activation of IFN1 signaling by TAK-981 in blood, spleen, or tumor of A20-tumor bearing or B16F10-tumor bearing mice
(Submitter supplied) Intravenous administration of TAK-981 to Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice bearing A20 or B16F10 syngeneic tumors, respectively, resulted in a strong induction of IFN1 pathway genes in peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen and A20 tumor tissues. TAK- 981 dependent upregulation of IFN1 mRNA signature was determined from RNA-Seq data in peripheral blood, spleen and tumor of BALB/c mice bearing A20 tumors. Upregulation of IFN1 ssGSEA scores were calculated in peripheral blood at 4h (P = 0.0011) and 8h (P = 0.0001), in spleen at 4h (P = 0.0002) and 8h (P = 0.0020), and in tumor at 4h (P = 0.0095) and 8h (P = 0.0033) after treatment with the indicated doses of TAK-981. more...

217. Metabolic Reprogramming of Terminally Exhausted CD8+ T-cells by Interleukin-10 Enhances Anti-Tumour Immunity
(Submitter supplied) Terminally exhausted CD8+ T-cells, which hold certain level of anti-tumour cytotoxicity but largely reduced proliferation capacity, contribute directly to tumour growth control. However, this subpopulation do not respond to immune checkpoint blockades or most existing immunotherapies and are difficult to be reactivated. Here, we show that a half-life extended interleukin (IL)-10/Fc fusion protein directly expands the terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs and sustains their effector functions through in vivo metabolic reprogramming, leading to eradication of established solid tumours and durable cures in a majority of treated mice when combined with adoptive T-cell transfer immunotherapy. more...

218. Cytotoxic lymphocytes use mechanosurveillance to target biophysical vulnerabilities in cancer
(Submitter supplied) Immune cells identify cancer cells by recognizing characteristic biochemical features indicative of oncogenic transformation. Cancer cells have characteristic mechanical features, as well, but whether these biophysical properties also contribute to destruction by the immune system is not known. In the present study, we found that enhanced expression of myocardin related transcription factors (MRTFs), which promote migration and metastatic invasion, paradoxically compromised lung colonization by melanoma and breast carcinoma cells in an immune-mediated manner. more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Tumor radioresistance can be driven by ERK phosphorylation and its downstream targets. In this context, melanomas harboring constitutive MAPK/ERK activation have been considered for targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) with a radiolabeled melanin tracer ([131I]ICF01012), alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors (MEKi).   Experimental design: We used three dimensional (3D) melanoma spheroid models to evaluate the effects of TRT in combination with MEKi, in human BRAFV600E SK-MEL-3, NRASQ61K 1007 and WT B16F10 murine melanomas. more...

221. Inhibition of xCT Suppresses Melanoma progress
(Submitter supplied) Tumor cells increase glutamate release through the cystine/glutamate transporter xCT to balance oxidative homeostasis in tumor cells and promote tumor progression.  Here, we demonstrated that although inhibition of xCT either by pharmacological inhibitor (sulfasalazine, SAS), approved by FDA for inflammatory diseases, or genetic knockdown induced ROS-related death in melanoma cells. Taken together, our results reveal that inhibition of xCT by SAS is a promising therapeutic strategy for melanoma.

(Submitter supplied) Despite the remarkable successes of cancer immunotherapies, the majority of patients do not exhibit durable responses. While treatment resistance has frequently been attributed to clonal selection and immunoediting, currently, little evidence directly demonstrates this process in epithelial cancers. Here, we demonstrate in both mouse models and human cells, that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating transient cell-in-cell structures, which are impenetrable to immune-derived cytotoxic compounds and to chemotherapies. more...

234. RNA-seq in mouse CD8+ T cells cultured with medium with or without methionine
(Submitter supplied) Abnormal epigenetic patterns correlate with effector T cell malfunction in tumors. However, their causal link is unknown. Here, we show that tumor cells disrupt methionine metabolism in CD8+ T cells, thereby lowering intracellular methionine levels and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), resulting in loss of H3K79me2. Consequently, loss of H3K79me2 impaired T cell immunity. Our work reveals a novel mechanistic connection between methionine metabolism, histone patterns, and T cell immunity in the tumor microenvironment.

248. Transcriptomic analysis of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells in mouse subcutaneous tumor models
(Submitter supplied) CCR7+ tumor-infiltrating DCs (tDCs) transport tumor antigens from the tumor to the draining lymph node (dLN), and thus play a pivotal role in anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie tDC activity remain poorly understood. To elucidate this problem, we investigated the transcriptomic properties of CCR7+ tDCs in mouse subcutaneous tumor models.

253. Circulating tumor cells exit circulation while maintaining multicellularity augmenting metastatic potential
(Submitter supplied) Metastasis accounts for the majority of all cancer deaths, yet the process remains poorly understood. A pivotal step in the metastasis process is the exiting of tumor cells from the circulation, a process known as extravasation. However, it is unclear how tumor cells extravasate, and if multicellular clusters of tumor cells posses the ability to exit as a whole or must first disassociate. In this study, we use in vivo zebrafish and mouse models to elucidate the mechanism tumor cells use to extravasate. more...

280. Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of MICA/B Shedding Promotes NK Cell-Driven Tumor Immunity
(Submitter supplied) MICA and MICB (MICA/B) are expressed by many human cancers due to cellular stress and tag cells for elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes through NKG2D receptor activation.  However, tumors evade this immune recognition pathway through proteolytic shedding of MICA/B proteins.  We rationally designed antibodies targeting the MICA α3 domain, the site of proteolytic shedding, and found that these antibodies prevented loss of cell surface MICA/B by human cancer cells. more...

281. A Major Chromatin Regulator Determines Resistance of Tumor Cells to T cell Mediated Killing
(Submitter supplied) Many human cancers are resistant to immunotherapy for reasons that are poorly understood.  We used a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to killing by cytotoxic T cells, the central effectors of anti-tumor immunity.  Inactivation of >100 genes sensitized mouse B16F10 melanoma cells to killing by T cells, including Pbrm1, Arid2 and Brd7, which encode components of the PBAF form of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. more...

(Submitter supplied) Most immunotherapies benefit only subsets of cancer patients, except those with autoimmune diseases due to dysregulation of their immune system. Here, the ARE-del mouse model featuring IFNg-autoimmunity allowed us to examine the relationship between cancer, autoimmunity and immunotherapy. We demonstrate that systemic levels of IFNg below 20 pg/ml in ARE-del+/- (HET) mice exerts moderate anti-tumor effects and increase (p=0.02; ANOVA) overall survival (OS); while higher levels did not that replicate in vivo the anti-tumor “bell shape” response of IFNg. more...

(Submitter supplied) Global DNA hypomethylation and DNA hypermethylation of promoter regions—including tumor suppressor genes—are frequently detected in human cancers. Although many studies have suggested a contribution to carcinogenesis, it is still unclear whether the aberrant DNA hypomethylation observed in tumors is a consequence or a cause of cancer. We found that overexpression of Stella (also known as PGC7, Dppa3), a maternal factor required for the maintenance of DNA methylation in early embryos, induced global DNA hypomethylation and transformation in NIH3T3 cells. more...

Sox10, a transcription factor expressed in neural crest stem cells and a subset of progeny lineages, plays a key role in the development of melanocytes. We show that B16F10 melanoma cells transfected with siRNA specific for Sox10 display reduced migratory activity which in turn indicated that a subset of transcriptional regulatory target genes of Sox10 are likely to be involved in migration and metastasis of melanoma cells. more...
